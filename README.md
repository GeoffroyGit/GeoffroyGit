# Geoffroy Bertrais

## Hello :wave:

I'm a French data scientist.

I'm currently studing at [Le Wagon](https://github.com/lewagon) data science bootcamp.

## Take a peak :wink:

You can take a peak at these repos:
* Our school project: [front end](https://github.com/JulianBreaud/ephesusWeb) and [back end](https://github.com/GeoffroyGit/ephesus)
* If you're a youtube addict like me :sweat_smile: you might have a use for [this little project](https://github.com/GeoffroyGit/youtubeWatchlist)
* If you're a student from Le Wagon, you may be interested in [my answer](https://geoffroygit.github.io/referrals/notebooks/data_presentation.slides.html) to [this challenge](https://github.com/GeoffroyGit/referrals)
* If you need to put colors on maps, you can get inspired [here](https://github.com/GeoffroyGit/abeona)
